# Bidirectional-Visitor-Counter-with-Cloud-based-Realtime-Analytics-using-NodeMCU-ESP8266-PIR-Sensor
Keeping track on day to day visitor count is not much Handy. Sometime few  Visitor enter without tickets as result we are not able to get exact number of visitors.  Also, Currently it is not possible to keep track on number of visitor inside as a result  Sometime it create crowdy situation . So I am proposing a Bidirectional Visitor Counter with Cloud based Realtime Analytics. Putting NodeMCU ESP8266 at entrance and exit gate to count to number of person entry inside the hall and number of visitor exit simultaneously.   Also we will be able to get live update on number of visitor inside the hall.  It will also help to create a Day to day no. of visitor database with detailed analytics.
